    /*
    * Pat is an ordinary kid who works hard to be a great runner. As a part of training,
    * Pat must run sprints of different intervals on a straight trail.  The trail has numbered
    * markers that the coach uses as goals.  Pat's coach provides a list of goals to reach in order.
    * Each time Pat starts at, stops at, or passes a marker it is considered a visit.  Determine the
    * lowest numbered marker that is visited the most times during Pat's day of training.



For example, if the number of markers on the trail,  n = 5, and assigned sprints = [2, 4, 1, 3],
Pat first sprints from position 2 → 4. The next sprint is from position 4 → 1, and then 1 → 3. A marker
numbered position p is considered to be visited each time Pat either starts or ends a sprint there and each
time it is passed while sprinting. The total number of visits to each position in the example is calculated like so:
Total Visits Per Position
      Sprint	1	2	3	4	5
       2 → 4	 	☺→	→	→☺
       4 → 1	☺←	←	←	←☺
       1 → 3	☺→	→	→☺
Total Visits	2	3	3	2	0
Pat has visited markers 2 and 3 a total of 3 times each.  Since 2 < 3, marker 2 is the one matching
the problem description.
